- 👋 Hi, I’m Neil. Former video games professional and now a Product Designer in the mobile app space.
- 👀 I’m interested in beautiful design and great UI/UX
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code because I'd like to experiment with some ideas in my head. I also want to see if I can do it myself!
- 💞️ I’m looking for good luck and well wishes. And maybe some occasional help!
